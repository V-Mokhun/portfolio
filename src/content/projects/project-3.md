description: "This is a Freelance project.
This is a corporate website created using HTML, SCSS, JS. It is a part of my freelance work, where I was given a Figma design and also had to interact actively with a designer to make site look better. In the end I had to explain to a client different nuances in design and convince that changes were needed to enhance User Experience.
