description: "This project is an ecommerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to cart and actually buy them (well, sort of). It is built with React.js and Sanity.io as a headless CMS. It uses GraphQL for querying data from Sanity, Redux Toolkit for state management and Stripe for payments. There is also a blog where users can read blog posts and admins create, edit, and delete posts. The website is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes."
