title: "Dobrocrov"
type: "Corporate Website"
description: "This is a Freelance project.
It is a corporate website made using HTML, SCSS and JS.
There are many pages but I chose not to link them as the information there is repetitive.
I was developing this site by a Tilda template, so it was quite unusual experience, but in the end the client was satisfied with the result.
