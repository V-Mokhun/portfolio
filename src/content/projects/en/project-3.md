title: "Charus"
type: "Corporate Website"
description: "This project, undertaken on a freelance basis, involved the creation of a corporate website using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I collaborated closely with a designer to enhance both the visual appeal and functionality of the site. Beyond the technical aspects, effective communication played a crucial role as I pointed out design nuances to the client. Additionally, I undertook the task of persuading the client regarding the necessity of specific changes aimed at optimizing the overall User Experience (Text, images, spacing were too big, as well as container width)."
