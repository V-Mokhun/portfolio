title: "Charus"
type: "Corporate Website"
description: "This project, undertaken on a freelance basis, involved the creation of a corporate website using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Commencing with a Figma design, I collaborated closely with a designer to enhance both the visual appeal and functionality of the site. Beyond the technical aspects, effective communication played a crucial role as I elucidated design nuances to the client. Additionally, I undertook the task of persuading the client regarding the necessity of specific changes aimed at optimizing the overall User Experience."
