type: "Gaming Platform"
description: "This is a learning project. It's a neat gaming platform where you can discover and add various games to your library. Connect with fellow gamers, have a chat, import games from Steam, share your game reviews, and explore the rating charts. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just kicking off your gaming journey, GameHub has something for everyone. This website was built with Next.js and TypeScript as a frontend framework, Prisma as an ORM, and PostgreSQL as a database. The frontend state is managed with Zustand, and React Query is used for data fetching. Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui are used for styling."
