For the last few months, I've been extensively using [Supabase](http://supabase.com/) - both for work and for my bachelor's degree project. I feel like I've gained some experience with this BaaS, so this is my overview of working with it, including some quirks I faced, my preferred style of work, and some useful resources. I can't cover everything, but I will talk about what I find most important.

### Getting Started

If it's your first time with Supabase, I recommend going through the official docs for about 5 minutes or using AI for the basic setup. In a nutshell, you get a PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage (which can be integrated with S3), Edge Functions, Realtime, and much more included in your project. They also have a pretty generous free tier that I find is enough for my side projects.

**Initial Setup**

- Create a project in the [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
- Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started).
- Use `supabase login` to connect your account.
- If you haven't already, initialize the project in your repository with `supabase init`.
- Link your local project to a remote one with `supabase link`.
- To generate types from your database schema, use `supabase gen types typescript --project-id your-project-id > lib/database.types.ts`. Add the `--local` flag to generate types from your local instance.

**Helpful Resources**

Right from the start, I want to share a few cool resources to use when you work with Supabase:

- **For local development:** [Overview](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/overview)
- **For quickly setting up UI:** [Supabase UI Library](https://supabase.com/ui)
- **For generating SQL with AI:** [AI Prompts](https://supabase.com/ui/docs/ai-editors-rules/prompts)

### Development Workflows

There are two main ways I've found you can work with Supabase: directly through the dashboard or locally on your machine. I want to discuss both.

#### Through the Dashboard

This approach involves using the `SQL Editor` in the Supabase dashboard, writing snippets, and executing them directly. It's a comfortable experience if you are working on your own, on a project that nobody else is touching. I did it this way on my first Supabase project.

The main upside is that it's really fast when you need to make quick changes, add or remove records, columns, etc.

However, because you do everything manually, you have no way of tracking these changes. This is why you would have trouble syncing with other developers working on the same project — a problem I think we can all understand.

#### Through Local Development

A better way (in my humble opinion) is to work via [Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/overview). It provides a way to actually sync between developers, avoid making changes to the same database when working on different features, and generate migration files.

Basically, the idea is that you have your own instance of Supabase running locally via **Docker**, and you can do whatever you want with it — modify data, schema, etc. You run it using `supabase start`.

The official docs do a great job of explaining the basic steps, so here are the commands I use most often:

- `supabase db diff -f filename` - Generate a new migration file by comparing your local database with its state from the last migration.
- `supabase migration up` - Apply a migration to your local database.
- `supabase db push` - Push the latest migrations to your remote database. Using `supabase db push --dry-run` is useful for production to see the changes before applying them.
- To roll back a migration, I usually check out the commit I want to revert to, then run `supabase db reset`. After that, `supabase db diff -f revert-latest.sql` will generate a diff that drops the changes, which you can execute. Lastly, to fix the migration history, run `supabase migration repair --status reverted migration_id`.

I also like the way you can see your DB, existing triggers, functions, indexes, and migration history.

### Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips based on my experience.

- **Check Your RLS Policies:** Double, and triple-check your [Row-Level Security policies](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) when updating your database schema. We've all heard stories of misconfigured policies leading to data leaks. AI is usually good at generating them, but please, double-check its work.
- **Secure Your Storage:** Use [policies for Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage) as well, and also set limits on file size and extensions. For private files, use [Signed URLs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-createsignedurl).
- **Auto-Renew Signed URLs:** You can implement automatic renewal when a Signed URL expires. I did this by simply storing `url_expires_at` and `url_storage_path` in my database.
- **Utilize Extensions:** Make sure to explore and utilize the available [Postgres Extensions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions) like `pg_cron` for scheduling jobs.
- **Edge Functions with Cron Jobs:** I had a particular issue getting an edge function to work with a cron job. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1i40kbx/comment/m7ts8e6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) really helped me set it up correctly.
- **Batch Uploads:** If you need to batch upload media to storage, using AI to generate a Python script is very efficient.
- **Database Migration:** For migrating from one Supabase project to another, [check out this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore).
- **Next.js Caching:** Be aware that when you use `createServerClient()` in Next.js middleware or route handlers, it can unexpectedly cache responses. I spent about three hours figuring this out! To avoid it, pass a custom fetch option to disable caching:

```javascript
// Pass this option in createServerClient()
options: {
  global: {
    fetch: (url: any, options = {}) => {
      return fetch(url, { ...options, cache: "no-store" });
    },
  },
},
```

### Conclusion

Overall, Supabase fits really well for many use cases. I can't speak to how it scales for large production applications, but for low-to-mid-sized projects, the ecosystem it provides feels extensive and robust. However, you have to understand the consequences of vendor lock-in. As always, "it depends." :)
