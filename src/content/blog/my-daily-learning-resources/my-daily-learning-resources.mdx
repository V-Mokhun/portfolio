In this quick post I want to share the resources I'm using daily to keep up to date with programming news, and also some of my general life/hobby interests.

## Programming resources

### Hacker News

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is my go-to website for keeping up to date with programming stuff. You can find everything there: from microcontrollers development to database architecting.

Occasionaly there are also non-coding related news which are worth reading. **Be careful**, time flies by so fast when you are browsing, reading and engaging on this website.

### Software Engineering Daily

[Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) is another cool resource to learn about software engineering trends and listen to podcasts. I don't spend a lot of time there though, but occasionaly there are some interesting podcasts/articles.

### Syntax.fm

[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) is my favorite programming podcast out there, hosts Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski are really nice to listen to. This podcast specializes in web development. I am looking forward to each episode and everytime I learn something new.

Also they post new stuff on their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@syntaxfm), definitely recommend checking it out.

### Backend Banter

[Backend Banter](https://open.spotify.com/show/35trT95UkRVCkEb6tXndpF?si=75c6bae897a1438f) is another podcast I've become quite a fan of. Lane Wagner, founder of [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) hosts the show and has interesting guests, with focus on a backend development, but you get all types of people.

Currently the show has 2 seasons, and I have no clue if or when 3rd is going to come out, but I eagerly await

### Youtube channels

I also want to share a list of programming youtube channels I watch regularly and recommend checking out:

- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)

- [ByteGrad](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteGrad)
- [Dreams Of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofcode)

I probably skipped a few, but these are my main coding youtubers
