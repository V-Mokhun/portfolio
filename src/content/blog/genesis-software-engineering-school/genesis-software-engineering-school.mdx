## My Engineering Transformation at Genesis & KMA Software Engineering School

A few months ago, I was a developer focused on writing code. Today, after graduating from the **[Genesis & KMA Software Engineering School 5.0](https://academy.gen.tech/software-engineering-school)**, I feel like an engineer who builds systems. This isn't just a play on words; it's a fundamental shift in mindset, and I want to share how it happened.

### Challenge Accepted: The Bar Was Set High from the Start

It all began with a selection process that made one thing clear: this wasn't going to be easy. Logical tests, engineering challenges, and a technical task to build a weather forecast API acted as a filter, bringing together people genuinely passionate about solving complex problems. I was incredibly excited to become one of them.

### The Power of Community: Mentors, Cohorts, and Peer Review

The real magic of this school is its people. We were grouped into small cohorts, and I had the privilege of being mentored by **[Pavlo Kushneryk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-kushneryk-70961a127/)**, a Senior Back-end Engineer at **[Solidgate](https://www.linkedin.com/company/solidgate/)**. Our weekly calls were about much more than just homework; we discussed engineering culture, architectural trade-offs, and what it truly means to be a professional.

The culture of constant feedback through peer reviews and lively discussions with my classmates pushed me to search not just for a working solution, but for an elegant one.

### My "Aha!" Moments

The program was incredibly packed, but a few topics changed my approach forever:

- **Thinking Like a Product Company:** The lecture on the development stages of a product company, including the "valley of death," was an eye-opener. I finally saw the clear connection between the code I write and the stage a business is in.
- **Testing isn't boring, it's essential:** We didn't just learn theory. We spun up test databases and Redis instances, wrote real integration tests, and understood firsthand why they are the most critical shield against bugs in production.
- **Taming Microservices:** A topic I had only heard about became crystal clear. We covered service communication, patterns like Saga and Event Bus, and, most valuably, had a hands-on workshop where we broke down a monolith into microservices. It was a true breakthrough in my understanding of architecture.

### From Theory to Career

The program culminated in a unique opportunity: a resume review with **[Max Baginskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-baginskiy)**, Head of Engineering at **[Solidgate](https://www.linkedin.com/company/solidgate/)**, followed by a Job Fair in a dynamic speed-dating format. This wasn't just a "bonus"; it was a logical conclusion that turns knowledge into real career opportunities. I'm now actively interviewing with several companies from the Genesis ecosystem, feeling more confident than ever.

### A Bittersweet Note and the Conclusion

The only thing I regret is having to experience it all online from Poland, as the school is based in Kyiv. I'm sure the live energy and in-person collaboration would have made the experience five times better. Nevertheless, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to participate even in this format.

My key takeaway is simple: always seek opportunities to grow. Surround yourself with talented, driven people who push you to aim higher. Over these 2.5 months, I've grown more as an engineer than perhaps in the entire year before.

A huge thank you to the **[Genesis Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/school/genesis-academy-ua/)** team, our lecturers, mentors, and, of course, my cohort. It has been an incredible sprint, and I don't plan on stopping.
