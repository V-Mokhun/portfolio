I'm launching my blog today! I've been working on it for a while and I'm excited to finally share it with you. I'll be writing about web development, computer science and other topics that interest me. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

I plan to post about twice a month. I feel like this is a good balance between quality and quantity. I want to make sure that I'm putting out content that is helpful and interesting, but I also don't want to overwhelm myself with too much work.

If you are curious about how I added this blog to my website, let me dive into some details.

### How I Added a Blog to My Website

- **Design**: I am no designer, so I searched as many blogs as I could and picked, what I thought, was the best design. Then I adjusted it to the website's color scheme and here we are. I would also like to thank [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) for the blog design inspiration because it seems I took the most from his blog.
- **Development**: It was quite straightforward to do, thanks to Astro. I also liked the View Transitions API that Astro provides, hope you like it too. I want to mention the [Brad Traversy's Astro Blog Repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/astro-blog/) that I used as a starting point.

I'm also planning on redesigning the whole website, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.
